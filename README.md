# About This Project
TP;NS was founded in 2014 for the world's first virtual hackthon hosted by Koding.com. EULA Thingy is a Django-based web application which combines the two powerful elements of crowdsourced information and machine learning. We hope this will provide the online community with a way to quickly summarize legal resources.

# What did we actually manage to achieve?
Well, the hope was to create a system where it could locate similar entries and automatically predict the rating that should be applied. However, you soon realise that 48 hours isn't a massive amount of time and when you're trying to do things you've never done before, it gets a lot smaller - And EVEN smaller with two people!

We managed to get the system to pull out the sentences and then allow users to assign a rating, which we then use highlight individual sentences. We're pleased with what we've done and we're going to work on it a bit to both improve our skillset and add some of things we missed.

It was a great experience, thanks a lot to Koding for hosting it!
